### PRs to retrieve

# Owner of the repository (in github urls, example: fabien-marty)
# (can be overriden by the command line argument --owner)
owner = ""

# Repository (without slashes, example: gh-pull-requests-stats-retriever)
# (can be overriden by the command line argument --owner)
repo = ""

# To select the PRs to retrieve in this repo, you can add multiple:
# [[select_prs]] sections with keys: state (mandatory) and updated_seconds (optional)
[[select_prs]]
state = "open" # state of the PR: open, closed or all

[[select_prs]]
state = "closed"           # state of the PR: open, closed or all
updated_seconds = 31536000 # PRs updated in the last X seconds (if the keyword is not present or if X <= 0, it will be ignored)

### Statistics to retrieve

# To retrieve statistics on the PRs, you can add multiple:
# [[labels_stats]] sections with the labels mandatory key
# labels key is an array of labels
# - if there is more than one label, statistics will be computed for the intersection of the labels
# - if a label starts with "-" (minus), we consider the absence of the label (and not the presence)
